A little game inspired by the prisoners dilemma game / game theory.

To start: `$ npm start`.

[Live Demo](https://tomahawk-jupiter.github.io/game-theory/)

## More Ideas

- Add more opponent algorithms
  - do this in `functions/decisionAlgorithms.js`
  - also add the new aiName in as an option in the select element in the `menu` page

- Multiplayer
  - use socket.io to make a multiplayer version
  - make a waiting lobby area where a player will wait until an opponent joins
