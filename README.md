## More Ideas

- Game

  - Add more opponent algorithms: do this in functions/decisionAlgorithms and add the name as an option in the menu page select element.
  - When score increases show in green, or red for wasted / opponent win

- Multiplayer
  - use socket.io to make it multiplier
  - make a waiting lobby area where a player will wait until an opponent joins
